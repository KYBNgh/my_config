## My Config
This is my Arch Linux config including shell(bashrc, profile, inputrc, ...), neovim and kitty. A part of it comes from @gnuunixchad.
I am writing a bash script to one-click deployment. It can works in Termux, too. But the script is a half-finished product.

## Usage
1. Backup your config

2. Clone this repo
```sh
mkdir ~/git
cd ~/git

git clone https://github.com/KYBNgh/my_config.git ~/git/
```
3. Create symlinks
```sh
# There is a script available!
# You just need run it!
./install.sh
```
